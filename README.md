## Installing Environment Variables and Running a React 16.12 Web Application Locally

This README file provides instructions for installing dependencies and running a web application project built with React 16.12 in a local environment. It also covers the configuration of environment variables required for the proper functioning of the application.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

Node.js: You can download and install Node.js from the official website: https://nodejs.org
version: 16.14.2

## Install dependencies

### `npm install` / `yarn install`

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start` / `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000] to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

## Additional Information

If you want to build the project for production, you can run the following command:

### `npm run build` / `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run serve` / `yarn serve`

If you encounter any issues during the installation or execution of the project, be sure to check the official React documentation and search for possible solutions within the community.
